# Cells
## Everything you want to know about this:
Cells, is a simulation - like programm. It simulates a bunch of particles, flying around the screen, forming structures, and chasing each other. This programm is easily editable, look below for a guide. Also, if you want to add something, i'm happy to look. Also, it's not really optimized, so you shouldn't run it on 1850 computers, or something older.
### Maybe, you want to make your own simulation, with your own cells. So, this is guide how to create new cell types. You need to:
1 - **__Edit CELL_TYPES__** - first line (index 0) is color, second line (index 1)... just don't touch it, it won't do anything. And all the over lines is cells influence. (place how influence works here)\
2 - **__Edit line 287__** - here you can choose which cell types will be created on the start.
### Also, you can press WASD and SPACE to control white cells. It will add some ac—Åeleration to them. (place how acceleration works here)
That's all, as i think. Thanks for reading!
